# RepeatString

Write a function that simply repeats the string a given number of times:

```javascript
repeatString('hey', 3) // returns 'heyheyhey'
```

You will notice in this quiz that there are multiple tests (see in file `repeatString.spec.js`). Only the first test is currently enabled. So after making sure that this first one passes, enable the others one by one by deleting the `x` in front of the `it()` function.


## Hints

- If running `jasmine repeatString.spec.js` raises `Temporarily disabled with xit` errors, make sure you have enabled the rest of the tests (see above).
